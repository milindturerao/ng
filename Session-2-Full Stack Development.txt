-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Now a days in the industry companies are following Microservices architecture to develop the applications.

-> Microservices is an Architectural Design Pattern which is used to develop our applications with loosely coupling and easy maintenence.

-> As part of this Microservices architecture we will develop business logics as Rest Apis.

-> REST APIS are for B 2 B communication (Business to Business Communication).

Fullstack Development :Backend Development (REST apis) + Frontend Development (UI)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> As a fullstack developer we are going to develop web applications.

What is a web application?
---------------------------
-> The application which runs in server is called as web application.

-> Multiple users can access web applications at a time by using internet.

	Ex: Facebook, Gmail, IRCTC etc.....

-> We can see 2 types of web applications

		1) Multi page web applications
		2) Single page web applications

-> In Multi page web applications for every request new web page will be loaded at client side. Here everytime entire page will be reloaded.

-> In Single page web application web page will be loaded only for first request. From second request onwards only content will be updated without reloading the entire page.
