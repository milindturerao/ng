         Typography
----------------------------------------------------------------------------		 
		1)Use a native font stack that selects the best font-family for each OS and device.
		
		2)For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browserâ€™s default root font-size 
		(typically 16px)so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.
		
		3)Use the $font-family-base, $font-size-base, and $line-height-base attributes as our typographic 
		base applied to the <body>.
		
		4)Set the global link color via $link-color.
		
		5)Use $body-bg to set a background-color on the <body> (#fff by default).

Inline text elements ->Styling for common inline HTML5 elements.

<p>You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
<p><del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del></p>
<p><s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s></p>
<p><ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins></p>
<p><u>This line of text will render as underlined.</u></p>
<p><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
<p><strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong></p>
<p><em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em></p>

Beware that those tags should be used for semantic purpose:

<mark> represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes.
<small> represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text.
<s> represents element that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.
<u> represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
If you want to style your text, you should use the following classes instead:

.mark will apply the same styles as <mark>.
.small will apply the same styles as <small>.
.text-decoration-underline will apply the same styles as <u>.
.text-decoration-line-through will apply the same styles as <s>.
