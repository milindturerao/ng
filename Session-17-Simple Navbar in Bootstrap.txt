How it works
Hereâ€™s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:
 
Supported content
Navbars come with built-in support for a handful of sub-components. Choose from the following as needed:

.navbar-brand for your company, product, or project name.
.navbar-nav for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).
.navbar-toggler for use with our collapse plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors.
.form-inline for any form controls and actions.
.navbar-text for adding vertically centered strings of text.
.collapse.navbar-collapse for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.
