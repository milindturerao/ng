				Session-01- Pre-Requisites: Types of Language
			  =================================================


  Language : we us language to communicate between human.
             example: Marathi,Hindi,English.
  Language Problem: both person should no same language. else
                    will face problem for communication.
					
	
  Programming Language:
             1)Low Language  : which language directly speek to electroincs device 
			                   that is called low language.
							   Example: Assambley Language.
							   software : Embeded Software 
							   Example  : TV Remote,Washing Machine,Micro-Wave.
             2)High Language :			 
                          we use intermidate
						   for speek with computer in binary language as a translator
				translator is nothing but it is a compiler or interpreter.


 2.Types of Programming Language
		A)Low Level.
		   Assembling.
		B)High Level.
				There are 3 ways to write and orgnize code.
		      1.procedural programming: which style more focus on steps to write code that is 
										called procedural.
										
									
										
					Example:-  	
                                     //addition of two number
									 
									 int a,b,c;
										void addition()
										{
										  //step 1 variable declaration
										a=10;       //step 2 initilize variable a
										b=20;       //step 3 initilize variable b.
										c=a+b;      //
										int x=110;  // invalid step we cannot declare variable
										print(c);
										
										
										}					
										
					c programming,ADA,Pascal.
					
			  2.functional Programming: 
			  which style more focus on functions which takes data and process it and return.
			  it is called functional programming.
			  
			                   int a,b,c;
							   void input()
							   {
							   a=prompt('enter value for a');
							   b=prompt('enter value for b ');
							   }
							   
							   void addition()
							   {
							        c=a+b;
							   }
			   
			                   input();
							   addition();
							   input();
							   addition();
			  
						javascript,vb script,python
			  3.object oriented programming: which style we write code in classes and we can
			                                 create object it contains Data+Method.
											 
					class Calculator
									{
									int a,b,c;
									
									public void input()
									{
									a=sc.nextInt();
									b=sc.nextInt();
									}
									
									public void addition()
									{
									c=a+b;
									}
									
									public static void main(String args[])
									{
									
									Calculator cal=new Calculator();
									cal.input();
									cal.addition();
									
									}
									

									}					
			                                  
					c++,c#,Vb.Net,php,java, etc..
