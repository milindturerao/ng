Session-05-Badges Concept in Bootstrap

	Examples:->
	
		Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative 
		font sizing and em units. As of v5, badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.\
		
		simple:-> badge Class "badge" , "bg-color";
		
	Buttons:->
	
		Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter
		
		Class:-> Create button using "btn", "btn-color" this class insite the class get a <span></span> tag
		in span giv a class "badge" , "bg-color";

Positioned
	Use utilities to modify a .badge and position it in the corner of a link or button
	
	Class:-> Create button using "btn", "btn-color" this class insite the class get a <span></span> tag
	in span giv a class "position-absolute" , "top-0" , "start-100", "translate-middle" , 
	"badge" , "rounded-pill", "bg-danger"
	
	type Span insite the class get a <span></span>unread messages
	class:-> "visually-hidden"
	
	
Background colors:-> Use our background utility classes to quickly change the 
appearance of a badge. Please note that when using Bootstrap’s default .bg-light, you’ll 
likely need a text color utility like .text-dark for proper styling. This is because background 
utilities do not set anything but background-color

	class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-primary"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-success"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-danger"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-warning text-dark"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-info text-dark"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-light text-dark"
		  "badge rounded-pill bg-dark"
